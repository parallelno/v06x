HOW TO BUILD FOR 32-BIT MINGW32
===============================

0. Install mingw32 + msys to c:\MinGW

1. Boost (tested with 1.67)

Download and extract to e.g. %USERPROFILE%/projects/vector06sdl/boost_1_67_0

  set BOOST_ROOT=%USERPROFILE%/projects/vector06sdl/boost_1_67_0
  cd %BOOST_ROOT%
  bootstrap gcc
  b2 toolset=gcc link=static stage 

This will compile 72 bloody libraries, which takes a long time (Boost is a header-only library!).
It's possible to compile only parts of the libraries, but cmake seems to be acting up with partial
builds so it may be time-saving to just buggerall compile everything.

The libraries will end up in stage/ where they will have completely fucked up names that 
FindBOOST.cmake will never be able to figure out, because it's a world-class build tool.
I also linked %BOOST_ROOT%/stage/lib to %BOOST_ROOT%/lib

Rename required libraries manually to sensible names, so that cmake is able to find them:

  libboost_chrono.a
  libboost_filesystem.a
  libboost_program_options.a
  libboost_system.a
  libboost_thread.a

2. SDL2

Just bloody download a windows build and copy i686 subtree to c:\MinGW

Make sure to delete or rename libSDL2.dll.a because it's impossible to tell cmake to ignore it.

3. SDL2_Image

Can live without it.

4. in MSYS shell

export BOOST_ROOT=$USERPROFILE/projects/vector06sdl/boost_1_67_0
cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j8

Boost is a world-class library so it will throw a buttload of warnings which can only be ignored.
